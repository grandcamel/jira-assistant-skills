### jira-time (2026-01-31)

**Status:** 14 issues found (2 high, 8 medium, 4 low) - 77% accuracy

The jira-time skill documentation has comprehensive coverage of all 9 CLI commands (log, worklogs, update-worklog, delete-worklog, estimate, tracking, report, export, bulk-log), but contains several critical errors that will cause runtime failures.

**Critical Issues:**
1. Line 155: Example uses unsupported `--reduce-by` flag with log command
2. Lines 79-83: Common Options table missing worklogs filter options
3. Lines 92-94: Documentation incorrectly claims `--reduce-by` works with log command

**Key Findings:**
- 2 examples that will fail at runtime
- 5 missing or incomplete option documentations
- 4 example style inconsistencies
- Several command-specific feature limitations not documented

**Files:**
- `jira-time.json` - Structured findings (14 issues with IDs, types, severity levels)
- `jira-time-review.md` - Comprehensive narrative report with detailed explanations and recommendations

**Files Generated:**

## Review Methodology

Reviews follow a systematic approach:

1. **Documentation Review**: Read the complete SKILL.md file
2. **CLI Analysis**: Run actual CLI commands and subcommands with --help
3. **Comparison**: Map documented features against actual CLI behavior
4. **Categorization**: Classify issues by type and severity
5. **Reporting**: Generate both structured (JSON) and narrative (Markdown) reports

## Issue Categories

- **WRONG_SYNTAX**: Examples that don't match actual CLI syntax
- **MISSING_COMMAND**: Documented command doesn't exist
- **UNDOCUMENTED_COMMAND**: CLI command not mentioned in documentation
- **UNDOCUMENTED_OPTION**: CLI option not documented
- **OUTDATED_OPTION**: Documentation uses outdated or inconsistent flag forms
- **MISSING_OPTION**: Command supports option not documented
- **EXAMPLE_ERROR**: Example has syntax errors or inconsistencies

## Severity Levels

- **HIGH**: Issues that cause runtime failures or critical inaccuracies
- **MEDIUM**: Issues that cause confusion or mislead users
