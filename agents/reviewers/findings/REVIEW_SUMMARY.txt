================================================================================
FINDINGS DETAIL
================================================================================

FINDING 1: jira-admin Keywords Incomplete
Severity: LOW
Location: Routing keywords, lines 64-65
Issue: Hub only routes on: "permissions", "project settings", "automation"
Missing: "users", "groups", "notification scheme", "screens", "issue types", 
         "workflows", "workflow scheme", "project category"
Impact: Some admin operations won't be routed correctly
Recommendation: Expand routing keywords to include all documented capabilities

FINDING 2: jira-ops Keywords Missing Diagnostics
Severity: MEDIUM
Location: Routing keywords, lines 64
Issue: Quick Reference mentions "diagnostics" but keyword routing doesn't include it
Also missing: "performance", "request batching", "cache status", "cache clear"
Impact: Diagnostic requests may not route to jira-ops
Recommendation: Add missing diagnostic and performance keywords

FINDING 3: jira-lifecycle Keywords Missing Version/Component Management
Severity: MEDIUM
Location: Routing keywords, lines 57
Issue: Quick Reference mentions "manage versions/components" but keywords don't
Missing: "version", "release", "component", "resolve", "reopen", "archive"
Impact: Version/component management requests may not route correctly
Recommendation: Add version and component management keywords

FINDING 4: Discoverability Commands Not Verified
Severity: WARNING
Location: Lines 204-205
Issue: Documentation references:
  - /jira-assistant-skills:browse-skills
  - /jira-assistant-skills:skill-info <name>
These commands may not be implemented in the plugin
Impact: Users may try to use commands that don't exist
Recommendation: Verify these commands are implemented or update documentation

FINDING 5: Previous Bulk Description Issue (NOW FIXED)
Status: RESOLVED
Original issue: Hub said "10+ issues" but skill targets "50+ issues"
Current state: Hub correctly states "50+ issues" ✓
Improvement: Description now matches skill's actual scale guidance

FINDING 6: Previous jira-jsm Description Issue (NOW FIXED)
Status: RESOLVED
Original issue: Quick Reference was incomplete (missing approvals, assets, knowledge base)
Current state: Hub correctly lists all capabilities ✓
Improvement: Full feature set now in Quick Reference table

FINDING 7: Previous jira-fields Description Issue (NOW FIXED)
Status: RESOLVED
Original issue: Hub said "Find custom field IDs" (too narrow)
Current state: Hub correctly states "Custom field discovery and Agile field configuration" ✓
Improvement: Full scope now documented

================================================================================
STRENGTHS
================================================================================

1. Complete Coverage: All 13 skills have clear routing rules
2. Accurate Descriptions: 100% match between hub and actual skills
3. Good Risk Documentation: Risk levels clearly stated for all skills
4. Excellent Context Awareness: Detailed guidance on pronoun resolution, project scope, context expiration
5. Comprehensive Workflows: Common workflows documented with step-by-step guidance
6. Strong Disambiguation: "When to Clarify First" section provides good examples
7. Clear Negative Triggers: All skills have well-documented non-applicable scenarios
8. Proper Error Handling: Error recovery and permission awareness documented

================================================================================
QUALITY METRICS
================================================================================

ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS (PRIORITY ORDER)
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (1 item):
1. Verify Discoverability Commands
   - Confirm /jira-assistant-skills:browse-skills and /jira-assistant-skills:skill-info <name>
   - Either implement or remove from documentation

MEDIUM PRIORITY (3 items):
1. Expand jira-admin routing keywords to include users, groups, notifications, screens, issue types, workflows
2. Expand jira-ops routing keywords to include diagnostics, performance, request batching
3. Expand jira-lifecycle routing keywords to include version, release, component, resolve, reopen, archive

LOW PRIORITY (2 items):
1. Add 2-3 more edge-case examples in "When to Clarify First" section
2. Clarify what constitutes a "message" in context expiration rules (line 157)

ENHANCEMENT (1 item):
1. Add explicit skill precedence/tiebreaker rules: "When multiple skills match equally, prefer X"
