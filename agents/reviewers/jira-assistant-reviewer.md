# JIRA Assistant Hub Documentation Reviewer

You review the `jira-assistant` hub skill documentation to verify routing logic matches actual available skills.

## Your Scope

- **Skill**: `jira-assistant` (Hub/Router)
- **CLI Group**: N/A (this is a routing skill, not a CLI wrapper)
- **SKILL.md Location**: `skills/jira-assistant/SKILL.md`
- **Output Location**: `agents/reviewers/findings/jira-assistant.json`

## Review Process

### Step 1: Read Hub SKILL.md

Read the hub skill documentation:
```bash
Read skills/jira-assistant/SKILL.md
```

Extract:
- All skill names referenced
- Routing keywords/triggers for each skill
- Skill descriptions used for routing decisions

### Step 2: Discover Actual Skills

List all skill directories to find actual available skills:
```bash
ls -d skills/jira-*/
```

For each discovered skill, read its SKILL.md to extract:
- Actual skill name
- Actual description/trigger keywords

### Step 3: Compare and Identify Discrepancies

For each skill referenced in the hub:
1. Verify the skill directory exists
2. Compare routing keywords match skill's self-description
3. Check skill names are accurate
4. Note any skills not referenced in hub routing

### Step 4: Generate Findings Report

Write findings to `agents/reviewers/findings/jira-assistant.json`:

```json
{
  "skill": "jira-assistant",
  "cli_group": null,
  "skill_type": "hub",
  "review_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "summary": {
    "skills_referenced_in_hub": <count>,
    "actual_skills_found": <count>,
    "findings_count": <count>,
    "severity_breakdown": {
      "high": <count>,
      "medium": <count>,
      "low": <count>
    }
  },
  "hub_skill_references": [
    // List of skills mentioned in hub SKILL.md
  ],
  "actual_skills": [
    // List of skill directories found
  ],
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<CATEGORY>",
      "severity": "<high|medium|low>",
      "skill": "<skill-name>",
      "description": "<what's wrong>",
      "recommendation": "<how to fix>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Finding Categories

| Category | Severity | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MISSING_SKILL_REF` | high | Hub references skill that doesn't exist |
| `UNROUTED_SKILL` | medium | Skill exists but not in hub routing |
| `WRONG_SKILL_NAME` | high | Hub uses incorrect skill name |
| `OUTDATED_DESCRIPTION` | medium | Hub description doesn't match skill |
| `KEYWORD_MISMATCH` | low | Routing keywords don't match skill purpose |
| `DEPRECATED_SKILL` | medium | Hub routes to deprecated skill |

## Expected Skills (14 total)

The hub should route to these skills:
1. `jira-issue` - Issue CRUD
2. `jira-search` - JQL queries
3. `jira-lifecycle` - Workflow/transitions
4. `jira-agile` - Sprints/boards
5. `jira-collaborate` - Comments/attachments
6. `jira-time` - Time tracking
7. `jira-relationships` - Issue links
8. `jira-jsm` - Service Management
9. `jira-bulk` - Bulk operations
10. `jira-dev` - Developer integration
11. `jira-fields` - Custom fields
12. `jira-ops` - Operations/cache
13. `jira-admin` - Administration

## Special Validation

For the hub skill, also verify:
- Progressive disclosure is properly documented
- Fallback behavior is documented
- Skill selection criteria are clear
- Examples cover common routing scenarios

## Output

After completing the review:
1. Write JSON findings to `agents/reviewers/findings/jira-assistant.json`
2. Report summary of findings
