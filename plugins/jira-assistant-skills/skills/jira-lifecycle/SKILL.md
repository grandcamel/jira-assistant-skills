# jira-lifecycle

Workflow and lifecycle management for JIRA issues.

## Quick Discovery

**Use this skill to:** Drive issues through workflows, assign ownership, manage releases and components.

**Not for:** Creating/editing issue content (use jira-issue) or finding issues (use jira-search).

**Also see:** [Workflow Guide](references/workflow_guide.md) | [JSM Workflows](references/jsm_workflows.md) | [Best Practices](docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md)

## What this skill does

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the `jira` CLI. Never run Python scripts directly.

7 command categories for complete lifecycle management:

| Category | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Transitions** | Move issues between statuses | `jira lifecycle transition PROJ-123 --name "In Progress"` |
| **Assignments** | Control ownership | `jira lifecycle assign PROJ-123 --user user@example.com` |
| **Resolution** | Mark issues complete | `jira lifecycle resolve PROJ-123 --resolution Fixed` |
| **Reopen** | Restore resolved issues | `jira lifecycle reopen PROJ-123` |
| **Versions** | Plan and track releases | `jira lifecycle version create PROJ --name "v2.0.0"` |
| **Components** | Organize by subsystem | `jira lifecycle component create PROJ --name "API"` |
| **Discovery** | View available options | `jira lifecycle transitions PROJ-123` |

All commands support `--help` for full option documentation.

## Available Commands

### Workflow Transitions
```bash
jira lifecycle transitions PROJ-123         # List available transitions
jira lifecycle transition PROJ-123 --name "In Progress"  # Transition issue
jira lifecycle assign PROJ-123 --user email@example.com  # Assign issue
jira lifecycle resolve PROJ-123 --resolution Fixed       # Resolve issue
jira lifecycle reopen PROJ-123              # Reopen issue
```

### Version Management
```bash
jira lifecycle version list PROJ            # List versions
jira lifecycle version create PROJ --name "v2.0.0" --start-date 2024-01-01
jira lifecycle version release PROJ --name "v1.0.0"
jira lifecycle version archive PROJ --name "v0.9.0"
```

### Component Management
```bash
jira lifecycle component list PROJ          # List components
jira lifecycle component create PROJ --name "API"
jira lifecycle component update PROJ --name "API" --lead user@example.com
jira lifecycle component delete PROJ --name "Legacy" --force
```

## Common Options

All commands support these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--profile, -p` | Use a specific JIRA profile |
| `--output, -o` | Output format: `text`, `json`, or `table` |
| `--help` | Show help message and exit |

### Dry Run Support

Some commands support `--dry-run` to preview changes:

```bash
jira lifecycle component delete PROJ --name "API" --dry-run
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success - operation completed successfully |
| 1 | Error - operation failed (check stderr for details) |

## Examples

See [examples/LIFECYCLE_EXAMPLES.md](examples/LIFECYCLE_EXAMPLES.md) for comprehensive copy-paste examples.

## Workflow Compatibility

Works with standard JIRA workflows, custom workflows, JIRA Service Management workflows, and simplified workflows. Scripts automatically adapt to different configurations.

## Troubleshooting

See [references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues and solutions.

**Quick fixes:**
- "No transition found" - Run `jira lifecycle transitions ISSUE-KEY` to see available transitions
- "Transition requires fields" - Use `--fields '{"field": "value"}'` option
- "User not found" - Verify user email and project permissions

## Configuration

Requires JIRA credentials via environment variables (`JIRA_SITE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`).
